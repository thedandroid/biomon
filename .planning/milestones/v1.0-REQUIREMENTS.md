## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Existing functionality that must continue working -->

- [x] Real-time state sync via Socket.io — existing (v1.0)
- [x] Stress/panic roll resolution with table lookups — existing (v1.0)
- [x] Player management (add, remove, update) — existing (v1.0)
- [x] Effect lifecycle (create, apply, clear, undo) — existing (v1.0)
- [x] Session persistence (autosave, manual save/load) — existing (v1.0)
- [x] External read-only namespace for integrations — existing (v1.0)
- [x] Mission log and roll event history — existing (v1.0)
- [x] Cross-platform executable builds via pkg — existing (v1.0)

### Active (TypeScript Migration Goals) - ALL COMPLETE

- [x] Convert server.js to TypeScript with strict mode — v1.0 (Phase 5)
- [x] Convert utils.js to TypeScript with explicit function signatures — v1.0 (Phase 3)
- [x] Convert responseTables.js to TypeScript with typed table entries — v1.0 (Phase 3)
- [x] Convert createServer.js to TypeScript — v1.0 (Phase 4)
- [x] Define shared types for state, players, effects, events — v1.0 (Phase 2)
- [x] Update build process to compile TypeScript — v1.0 (Phase 1)
- [x] Update ESLint config for TypeScript — v1.0 (Phase 1)
- [x] All tests pass after migration — v1.0 (Phase 6)

### Out of Scope

- Client-side TypeScript (public/*.js) — would require client build pipeline, separate project
- Database backend — current file-based persistence is fine for now
- New features — this is a refactoring milestone, not feature work
